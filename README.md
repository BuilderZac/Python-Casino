# Python-Casino

This is just a simple side project I started in my free time. This project was started just to work more with file managment and with a goal of becoming something I can waste time in. This entire thing is a work in progress and there are some bugs. The ideal way to deploy this code is to rewite the save data location to what is an unmodifiable file for users and make sure the debug command is disabled. The save file should only be modified if a player goes bust and needs to be bailed out.

W.I.P I plan to add blackjack as a second game.
